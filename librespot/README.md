# Librespot addon for Home Assistant

*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. Act as a Spotify Connect receiver.

Runs with named pipe fifo output. 
Could be used with [Snapserver](https://github.com/amatashkin/hassio-addons/tree/master/snapserver) addon to run

_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case for the foreseeable future, as we are unlikely to work on implementing the features such as limited skips and adverts that would be required to make librespot compliant with free accounts._
